# Discord Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to set up the required Discord environment variables.

## Environment Variables

The application requires two Discord-related environment variables:

- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: The token for the Discord bot.
- `DISCORD_USER_ID`: The ID of the Discord user to notify.

### Getting Your Discord Bot Token

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application" and give it a name
3. Go to the "Bot" section in the left sidebar
4. Click "Add Bot"
5. Under the bot's username, click "Reset Token" and then "Copy"
6. Add this token to your `.env` file as `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`

### Getting Your Discord User ID

1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord:

   - Open Discord
   - Go to Settings (gear icon)
   - Under "App Settings", click on "Advanced"
   - Enable "Developer Mode"

2. Get your User ID:
   - Right-click on your username anywhere in Discord
   - Click "Copy User ID"
   - Add this ID to your `.env` file as `DISCORD_USER_ID`

### Bot Setup for Direct Messages

To allow the bot to send you direct messages:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your application
3. Go to "OAuth2" â†’ "URL Generator"
4. Under "Scopes", check:
   - `bot`
5. Under "Bot Permissions", check:
   - `Send Messages`
6. Use the generated URL to invite the bot to any server you're in

### Discord Privacy Settings

Ensure your Discord privacy settings allow DMs:

1. Open Discord
2. Go to User Settings (gear icon)
3. Click "Privacy & Safety"
4. Enable "Allow direct messages from server members"

## Security Notes

- Never share your bot token with anyone
- Don't commit the `.env` file to version control
- If you accidentally expose your bot token, reset it immediately in the Discord Developer Portal
